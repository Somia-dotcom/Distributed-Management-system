ABSTRACT
The Distribution Management System is a project developed using C#.net and SQL Server, aimed at transforming the existing manual ration shop system into an efficient and automated system. The manual system currently relies on human resources to maintain stock distribution records, balance stock details, and handle transactions, which leads to issues such as time consumption, salary hikes, and corruption. The proposed E-Ration System addresses these issues by leveraging technology to streamline the entire process. The system provides cardholders with the convenience of receiving notifications about the availability of stock items and the date of distribution. Based on the distribution date, the system enables token registration for cardholders, effectively managing the queue and allocating shopping timings. This eliminates the need for cardholders to stand in queues for hours, reducing time wastage and inconvenience. Furthermore, the E-Ration System automates processes such as stock item quantity tracking, pension calculation, member count management (including adding or deleting family members), automatic age calculation, shop opening and closing time display, and modification of personal information. The system also provides special time allocation facilities for physically challenged people, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity. The E-Ration System eliminates the need for maintaining hard copy records, simplifies the process of changing personal information in ration cards, and improves communication by notifying cardholders about distribution dates. The system also benefits stock providers by reducing crowding and making the process more efficient. Overall, the E-Ration System aims to eradicate the challenges of the manual ration shop system by leveraging technology to provide a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly solution for cardholders and stock providers alike.

INTRODUCTION

The ration system, also known as a Public Distribution System (PDS), is a government-led initiative to provide essential food commodities at subsidized prices to eligible beneficiaries. The ration system aims to ensure food security and alleviate poverty by making basic food items, such as grains, sugar, and cooking oil, available to economically weaker sections of the society.

The ration system typically involves the issuance of ration cards to eligible households, which entitle them to purchase specified quantities of food items from designated ration shops or fair price shops. These ration cards are usually categorized into different types based on the economic status of the beneficiaries, such as Below Poverty Line (BPL), Above Poverty Line (APL), and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), among others.

The ration system is typically managed by the government or local authorities, who are responsible for procuring, storing, and distributing food items to ration shops. Ration shop owners are responsible for verifying the eligibility of beneficiaries, maintaining records of transactions, and distributing the allocated quantities of food items to cardholders.

The ration system plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and providing nutritional support to vulnerable sections of the society. However, manual management of ration shops can be time-consuming, prone to corruption, and inefficient. Therefore, the digitization of ration shops, such as the proposed "E-Ration System" project, can help streamline the process, improve transparency, and enhance the overall efficiency of the ration distribution system.
Introduction to the Project - E-Ration System:

The existing manual ration shop system relies on human resources to manage stock distribution records, transaction details, and balance stock information. However, this system is plagued by several issues such as time-consuming processes, salary hikes, corruption, long queues for cardholders, difficulty in maintaining hard copy records, challenges in updating personal information, and lack of information about distribution dates. Physically challenged individuals also face difficulties in shopping.

To overcome these challenges, the proposed project "E-Ration System" aims to develop a digital solution using C#.net and SQL Server to streamline the ration distribution process. The system includes two main modules: the Employee Module and the Card Holders Module. The Employee Module provides functionalities for stock and member management, relief fund distribution, token registration, shop timing management, and report generation for authorized employees. The Card Holders Module allows registered cardholders to access stock availability information, register for tokens, update personal information, apply for relief fund, receive message notifications, and view shopping history.

The proposed system eliminates the manual processes, reduces the chances of corruption, and provides convenience to cardholders by allowing them to register for tokens and shop during allocated timings. It also offers message notifications about stock availability and distribution dates, facilitates easy updates of personal information, and provides special time allocation for physically challenged individuals. The system aims to improve the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of the ration distribution process, providing a user-friendly and technology-driven solution for managing ration shops.
